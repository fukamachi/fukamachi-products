# fukamachi-products
I try to write How to use fukamachi products. [fukamachi (Eitaro Fukamachi) / Repositories](https://github.com/fukamachi?tab=repositories)

This is **unofficial** documents depends on my poor understandings.
I want to expand the Common Lisp User's community.

## for web development
to develop web applications, you may write with Caveman2.

### [Caveman2](https://github.com/fukamachi/caveman)
  You need to write mainly in Caveman.
  This internally uses packages below.
  This uses lack's builder to wrap with lack's middleware.
### [Clack](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack)
  I don't know the role of this layer.
### [Lack](https://github.com/fukamachi/lack)
  This has middleware.
  This layer wraps web server's differences.
### (web servers)
- Hunchentoot(not fukamachi products)
- [Woo](https://github.com/fukamachi/woo)
- FastCGI(not fukamachi products)
- wookie(not fukamachi products)
### ningle
I think this is deprecated or merged into Caveman.

## Common Lisp tools
### [qlot](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)
project-local library installer
